## DiffCount

A tool to count the difference between reports generated by Sol and TEW.

### Running

Just navigate to a folder in which the .xlsx files are in and run:

```
    python -m diffcount
```

### Action Points

There are negative values in the SOL export. Is this relevant?

Yes. We need to have those negative values as billing quantities move from category to category.

### Dependencies

- **Python Modules:**

    - `pandas`: for analyzing and saving data.
    - `xlsxwriter`: pandas dependency for opening xlsx.
    - `colorama`: for displaying colors in the terminal, impoving legibility.
